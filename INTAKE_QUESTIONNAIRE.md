# Intake Questionnaire

Use this sequence before drafting any document.

## Step 0: Context Mode (Required)
Choose one:
1. **Document-First Mode** (project exists to write this document)
2. **Project-Embedded Mode** (document is part of a broader project)

Mode behavior:
- Document-First: full intake and full voice calibration
- Project-Embedded: lean intake, project context first, optional voice calibration

## Step 1: Objective and Context
1. What is the objective of this document?
2. Who is the target audience?
3. What decision or action should this document enable?
4. Who is the author of the document?

## Step 2: Message and Scope
5. What 3-7 key messages are non-negotiable?
6. What is in scope?
7. What should be explicitly out of scope?

## Step 3: Inputs and Evidence
8. What source materials should be used? (notes, prior docs, data, links)
9. Will the document cite external reports? If yes, which are primary (cited in body) and which are optional for a Sources section?
10. Are there factual constraints or assumptions that must be preserved?
11. (Project-Embedded only) What is the current project status, and what decisions are already locked?
12. (Project-Embedded only) What constraints from the project should this document not reopen?

## Step 4: Structure
13. Do you already have a required structure?
14. If yes, share section headers. If no, should the agent propose one?
15. Should the document follow a reference document’s header and section style (e.g. Title | Subtitle, Last Updated, Author, Purpose, Status; numbered sections 0 | Introduction, 1 | …, etc.)? If yes, which document?

## Step 5: Voice Calibration
Document-First: required.  
Project-Embedded: optional unless style matching is requested.

16. Share 3-5 writing samples from the same document type if possible.
17. Confirm desired balance: storytelling vs direct instruction.

Agent must then return a short style profile:
- sentence rhythm
- vocabulary tendencies
- transition style
- formatting preferences
- tone
- paragraph flow preference (connected narrative vs punchy short-form)

And ask: "Should I use this profile as-is?"

## Step 6: Default Style and Overrides
Agent should state default style in 2-4 bullets, then ask:
"Any style overrides for this document? If none, I will use the default system style plus your calibrated voice."

## Step 7: Drafting Mode
18. Do you want:
- outline first, then draft
- full draft directly

Recommended default: outline first, then draft after approval.
