# Writing System

A practical system for humans and AI agents to produce high-quality documents with clearer structure, stronger context intake, and faster revision cycles.

## What this includes

- `HOW_TO_USE.md` - quick usage guide
- `DOC_SYSTEM.md` - writing standards, quality gate, and revision protocol
- `INTAKE_QUESTIONNAIRE.md` - ordered context questions before drafting
- `AGENT_PROMPT_TEMPLATE.md` - reusable prompt framework for any agent
- `STARTER_PROMPTS.md` - copy-and-paste prompts for common workflows

## Quick start

1. Keep all files inside `writing-system/`.
2. Open Cursor and paste one prompt from `STARTER_PROMPTS.md`.
3. Let the agent run intake before drafting.
4. Approve the pre-draft package, then start draft/revision.

## Context modes

- **Document-First**: the main goal is writing a document.
- **Project-Embedded**: writing is one workstream inside a broader project.

Mode selection changes intake depth, voice calibration, and draft speed.

## Recommended reading order

1. `HOW_TO_USE.md`
2. `STARTER_PROMPTS.md`
3. `DOC_SYSTEM.md` (if you want to customize standards)
