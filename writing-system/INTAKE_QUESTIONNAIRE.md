# Intake Questionnaire

Use this sequence before drafting any document.

## Step 0: Context Mode (Required)
Choose one:
1. **Document-First Mode** (project exists to write this document)
2. **Project-Embedded Mode** (document is part of a broader project)

Mode behavior:
- Document-First: full intake and full voice calibration
- Project-Embedded: lean intake, project context first, optional voice calibration

## Step 1: Objective and Context
1. What is the objective of this document?
2. Who is the target audience?
3. What decision or action should this document enable?

## Step 2: Message and Scope
4. What 3-7 key messages are non-negotiable?
5. What is in scope?
6. What should be explicitly out of scope?

## Step 3: Inputs and Evidence
7. What source materials should be used? (notes, prior docs, data, links)
8. Are there factual constraints or assumptions that must be preserved?
9. (Project-Embedded only) What is the current project status, and what decisions are already locked?
10. (Project-Embedded only) What constraints from the project should this document not reopen?

## Step 4: Structure
11. Do you already have a required structure?
12. If yes, share section headers. If no, should the agent propose one?

## Step 5: Voice Calibration
Document-First: required.  
Project-Embedded: optional unless style matching is requested.

13. Share 3-5 writing samples from the same document type if possible.
14. Confirm desired balance: storytelling vs direct instruction.

Agent must then return a short style profile:
- sentence rhythm
- vocabulary tendencies
- transition style
- formatting preferences
- tone

And ask: "Should I use this profile as-is?"

## Step 6: Default Style and Overrides
Agent should state default style in 2-4 bullets, then ask:
"Any style overrides for this document? If none, I will use the default system style plus your calibrated voice."

## Step 7: Drafting Mode
15. Do you want:
- outline first, then draft
- full draft directly

Recommended default: outline first, then draft after approval.
